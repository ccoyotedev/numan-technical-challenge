This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + Typescript project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Getting Started

First, install dependencies by running:
```
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

# Task

Develop a simple purchase flow using a set of web API endpoints. Every step in the flow needs to send events back to the API.

# Outcome

I chose to use NextJS due to its ability to easily build statically generated web pages using external data. This is useful for eCommerce sites as it allows for better SEO.

The website makes use of localStorage + Cookies to store user's orders and personal details.


# Further improvements

If I was to take this project further, I would first write some tests to protect the current state of the app from regression. As it stands, I made good use of Typescript to ensure everything is type secure and give myself a more pleasent developer experience.

I would also add images for each product type, and improve the landing page for a better first impression.
