This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + Typescript project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

<p>&nbsp;</p>


## Getting Started

First, install dependencies by running:
```
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Task

Develop a simple purchase flow using a set of web API endpoints. Every step in the flow needs to send events back to the API.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Outcome

- I chose to use NextJS due to its ability to easily build statically generated web pages using external data. This is useful for eCommerce sites as it allows for better SEO.

- The website makes use of localStorage + Cookies to store user's orders and personal details.

## Further improvements

- If I was to take this project further, I would first write some tests to protect the current state of the app from regression. As it stands, I made good use of Typescript to ensure everything is type secure and give myself a more pleasent developer experience.

- I would also add images for each product type, and improve the landing page for a better first impression.
